# My Fish configuration

My configuration files for [Fish](http://fishshell.com/).


## Setup

You should delete or move the folder at `~/Documents/.config/fish`
before creating this link:

	ln -s my_fish_config ~/Documents/.config/fish


## FYI

This configuration has only been used on [Lubuntu](http://lubuntu.net/).


### .gitignore

`fishd.*` and `fish_history` are ignored so this repo can be linked into 
the normal Fish config area (`~/.config/fish`) and ignore the
automatically created files.
